/*Quote from Xilinx  "7 Series FPGA SelectIO Primitives":
The IBUF and IBUFG primitives are the same. IBUFGs are used when an input buffer is
used as a clock input. In the Xilinx software tools, an IBUFG is automatically placed at
clock input sites.

Actually, it still complains:

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (CKLD-2) Clock Net has direct IO Driver - Clock net clocks393_i/ibuf_ibufg_i/memclk_0 is directly
         driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer. Driverx393.s: clocks393_i/ibuf_ibufg_i/IBUF_i/O[VivadoPlace:0000]
